  "coaching_notes": "Next session: confirm whether the planned snack was actually consumed, portion size, and immediate feelings. If action was not taken, explore barriers (cravings, access, timing) and reinforce the value of small, consistent steps. Maintain a warm, non-judgmental tone; continue promoting simple, pre-planned options and mindful logging. Watch for any emerging all-or-nothing thinking and reframe as gradual progress."

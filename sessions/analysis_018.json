  "user_action_estimate": 1.0,

  "basis": "The user explicitly states an intention to avoid eating in response to urges this week and describes the planned micro-routine (name/rate urge, 20â€“60 second reset, 2-minute task, 5-minute non-food action) with a final log. There is no report of actual food intake in this turn.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Mild. The user recognizes stress as a BED trigger and commits to a simple, repeatable plan, but the ongoing struggle with stress-related urges suggests some internal tension about sustaining the change long-term.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Occasional all-or-nothing framing earlier (perfection) appears to be softening toward steady micro-patterns; lingering self-doubt about maintaining consistency under stress.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Stress remains a primary driver of BED urges; the user seeks simplicity to prevent stress spillover and maintain control.",
  "effective_reinforcement": [
    "Empathy",
    "Practical, actionable steps",
    "Normalizing setbacks and focusing on small gains"
  ],
  "coaching_notes": "Keep reinforcing ultra-simple, repeatable routines; continue to use urge rating, grounding, and self-compassion cues. Track mood/stress alongside urges to tailor interventions. Celebrate small wins and emphasize progression over perfection; consider periodically revisiting triggers and adjusting micro-actions to stay engaging."

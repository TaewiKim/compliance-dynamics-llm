    "agent_utterance": "You're doing well today. To take a small, doable step, try an evening pause-and-log routine: 60 seconds before you snack, check in with your hunger. If you’re actually hungry, pick a small, pre-portioned option (like a handful of nuts or a piece of fruit) or a warm non-snack alternative (tea or water). Then log the snack immediately in your app, within two minutes. Keeping this simple and fixed taps into your need for structure and helps move you toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: given the user’s high sensitivity to stress and strong need for structure, a brief pause before snacking plus immediate logging with a pre-portioned option supports evening cues and reinforces a stable habit without overhauling the routine.",

    "user_utterance": "Okay, I can try that pause-and-log habit tonight. I’ll pause 60 seconds before snacking, check if I’m truly hungry, and if I am, choose a small, pre-portioned option (like fruit or a handful of nuts) and log it right away. If I’m not hungry, I’ll skip the snack and note the pause. Let’s see how this changes my pattern.",

If you’re truly hungry, grab a single pre-portioned option (fruit or nuts), eat it, and log it within two minutes with a one-word hunger tag and a very brief note on how it felt. If you’re not hungry, skip the snack and log 'skipped—not hungry' along with a quick note about the pause. Keeping it lean and immediate supports your structure-seeking style and nudges you toward the desired pattern.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my detailed internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: your profile shows a strong need for structure and quick, concrete actions, especially in the evening.

To strengthen your pause-and-log routine during evening stress, add a tiny non-food reset after the 60-second pause: if you feel an urge, drink a glass of water, take 5 slow breaths, and log a one-word cue (like 'urge' or 'stress') plus one brief outcome. Keep it to about 2 minutes total, and log immediately. This keeps the routine lean, honors your structure, and helps reduce the impulse to snack while nudging you toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "High-level CBT rationale: evening stress heightens urges, so reinforcing a tiny, non-food coping step after the pause helps decouple urge from action.

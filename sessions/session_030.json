This simple, structured routine helps you feel in control, reduces late-night snacking, and nudges you toward healthier patterns over time.",
    "agent_monologue": "Your profile shows a strong need for structure and sensitivity to evening cues. Recent micro-actions helped calm urge to snack, so I’m recommending a tiny, fixed post-dinner ritual that requires minimal cognitive load. This uses behavioral activation and external cues to replace unplanned snacking with a controllable, predictable step, supporting gradual progress toward the target behavior.",

    "agent_utterance": "Tonight, after your water and light stretch, add a quick 1-minute hunger-and-emotion check. Rate your hunger 0–10 and name the feeling driving it (e.g., stress, tiredness, craving). If your hunger is low (3 or less), pause for 5 minutes and try a non-food reset (tea, a brief walk, or another stretch) before deciding on the snack. If hunger feels high, proceed with your pre-portioned snack. Then log the check and how you felt afterward. This tiny check-in helps you build a structured routine and strengthens the link between feelings and choices.",
    "agent_monologue": "Brief rationale: given her need for structure and sensitivity to evening cues, a brief, reflective micro-action reinforces the routine without overwhelming her. This small check-in ties emotions to behavior, supporting gradual progress toward the target habit level without exposing internal scores.",

If hunger is higher, I'll use my pre-portioned snack and log how I felt afterward. I'll keep you posted on how it goes.",

After you decide, either eat the snack in a mindful, measured way or complete the reset, then log what you did and how it felt. Keep the choice simple, and aim to repeat this exact approach tomorrow for consistency.",
    "agent_monologue": "High evening triggers and a strong need for structure suggest a tiny, highly doable step that can be logged easily. This nudges you toward the target by adding a clear, low-friction choice at craving time without adding friction to your routine.",

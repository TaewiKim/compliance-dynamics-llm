Keep the time consistent and jot down how you feel after. This small, reliable step helps build momentum without adding stress.",

To nudge you gently toward your target, keep the three-step after-dinner routine you outlined, and add a concise self-checkment right after (a one-word mood note about cravings or how you feel).

Log how you felt each night and treat any slip as data to adjust tomorrow, not a failure.",

A small next nudge: after you finish your three steps, add a 15-second post-routine check-in where you briefly note your craving level (0–10) and one quick thing that helped you feel calm (for example water, breath, or a short stretch). Keep the ritual fixed for the next three evenings. If cravings spike, you can extend the breath pause by 30 seconds at the start of the pause.

When evening stress or a craving hits, take a 60-second pause, then choose that snack first before reaching for other foods. This simple, predictable step supports your structure-driven goals and builds small, steady progress toward healthier eating.",

If you’re at 1–2, wait 10 minutes, then re-check—if hunger remains, use your snack as planned; otherwise, sip water or take a brief, relaxing activity. This keeps your step small and structured while nudging toward steadier eating.",
    "agent_monologue": "Brief rationale: The user has a strong need for structure and is sensitive to evening stress. A compact, two-step micro-action (pause plus a quick hunger check) creates a predictable cue that nudges toward a steady, mid-range behavior without adding cognitive load.

Keeping this step small and predictable supports your structure needs and nudges your eating toward steadier patterns.",
    "agent_monologue": "To support steady progress, I’m choosing a micro-step that fits her need for structure and sensitivity to stress: a brief, non-threatening anchor after the pause to assess hunger and guide the snack decision.

    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user shows a clear preference for micro-actions and a strong need for structure, especially in the evening when BED cues hit. Their ongoing plan uses an implementation-intent approach (if-then) with interoceptive checks (hunger scale) to reduce impulsive eating. The next nudge should reinforce simplicity, accountability, and self-reflection without adding friction. A brief post-action cue (one-line note) strengthens memory and builds confidence, supporting gradual progress toward higher consistency while honoring stress and routine constraints.",

Their current trajectory (score near 3) suggests a micro-step that reduces friction and relies on external cues rather than willpower.

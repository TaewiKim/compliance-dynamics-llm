I’ve been following guidance fairly well lately (about a 4.5 on adherence), so I’ll aim to keep that going.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice job planning your wind-down. Tonight, after you begin your 2-minute diaphragmatic breathing in the same spot, if the urge remains around 6/10, add one ultra-short micro-action for about 60 seconds—gentle movement in place (for example a light march or shoulder rolls)—then resume your stretches for another minute. Log your current urge and mood, and stay with the ultra-simple sequence. This slight extra step keeps you steady and helps you build toward the next level without increasing decision fatigue.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user benefits from ultra-simple, structure-preserving steps. With an urge around 6/10 and dinner-related tension, adding a tiny, optional micro-action after the breathing can create a quick win, maintain routine fidelity, and supply log data to tailor future steps. This aligns with a high need for structure and avoids introducing new complexity.",

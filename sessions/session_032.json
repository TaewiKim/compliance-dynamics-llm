This small, structured step helps move you toward a calmer, more consistent routine.",

Here’s a fresh, doable nudge: at the first urge, add a quick 5-minute movement burst ( brisk walk, stairs, or gentle stretches) to shift energy, then immediately log your plan for the next meal and jot one quick non-eating coping action you’ll use today (for example a short breathing break or a glass of water). Keeping it short and repeatable helps you build a reliable pattern toward the goal.",

Keep it under two minutes and reuse it with every urge. This tiny, reliable habit supports steady progress toward your goal, even during mood swings.",

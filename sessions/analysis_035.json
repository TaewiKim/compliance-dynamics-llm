  "basis": "The user repeatedly outlines intentions and a structured one-plate plan with mindful pauses, but there is no actual report of eating behavior, portions consumed, or fullness ratings in the current session.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "No explicit internal contradiction is voiced; the user acknowledges BED and difficulty but maintains commitment to a simple, structured approach. There is a latent action-intention gap suggesting mild cognitive dissonance between plan and execution.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Occasional framing of BED as 'tough' may reflect defeatist or all-or-nothing beliefs; however, there is also resilience and a focus on feasibility. No heavy self-blame is overt, but some avoidance of reporting actual eating behavior persists.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Cravings and stress are implied triggers for potential lapses; desire for structure and simplicity appears protective; motivation fluctuates with perceived difficulty of BED management.",
  "effective_reinforcement": [
    "Empathy",
    "Practical, doable steps",

  ],
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain a warm, non-judgmental tone; explicitly encourage completion of a post-meal log to assess action rather than intention alone. Continue with small, concrete micro-steps (e.g., report after meal, rate fullness, note triggers). Emphasize bridging intention-action gap by acknowledging progress while prompting real-world execution, and introduce gentle accountability (e.g., brief daily check-in prompts)."

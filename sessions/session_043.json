    "agent_utterance": "Tonight, try a tiny, reliable evening ritual: after a brief 2-minute pause with a glass of water and a couple of deep breaths, choose one simple, pre-portioned snack you can assemble in under 2 minutes—for example, a small apple with 1 tablespoon peanut butter. Eat at a fixed time (around your usual evening routine). Keep it straightforward, and afterward jot a one-line note about how you felt before and after to close the loop. This steady, low-friction step fits your need for structure and gently nudges progress over time.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: your profile shows a strong need for structure and a tendency to benefit from a short, fixed routine, especially in the evenings. A small ritual plus a simple, pre-portioned option reduces decision fatigue and helps you edge toward more consistent, health-supportive choices without triggering resistance.",

After a quick two-minute pause, I’ll have a small, pre-portioned snack—like an apple with 1 tablespoon peanut butter—around my usual dinner time, and I’ll note how I felt before and after. I’ve been doing okay with guidance lately, so I’m going to give this a real try despite the stress.",

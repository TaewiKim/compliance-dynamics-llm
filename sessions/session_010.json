This helps boost fullness with minimal effort and preserves your structured routine. After you log, pause for 2 minutes and choose one quick coping action (deep breath, gentle stretch, or a short walk) to support calmer choices. If you’re truly not hungry after the starter, you can skip the rest.",

If I’m not hungry after the starter, I’ll skip the rest—this feels doable with BED and my current pattern.",

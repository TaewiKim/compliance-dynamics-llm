If you’re truly hungry, enjoy a measured portion of yogurt with berries and log it immediately. If not hungry, pause for a moment, choose a non-food cue (drink water or take a short walk), and log that choice. This tiny pause helps protect against stress-driven snacking and supports steady progress.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise justification: your profile shows a strong need for structure and sensitivity to evening cues. A brief, deliberate check-in plus immediate logging aligns with your plan while reducing stress-driven snacking. It creates a small, manageable habit that can accumulate toward a steadier evening pattern without overwhelming you.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice work tonight. To keep building a calm, structured evening, try adding a brief non-food ritual right after your pause if you’re not hungry: a 2-minute stretch or a quick 1-minute breathing exercise, then log the ritual. If hunger returns later, have a small yogurt with berries and log it. Consistency with this routine helps your evening decisions become automatic.",
    "agent_monologue": "I’m accounting for the user’s evening cue sensitivity and strong desire for structure. The current actions show successful use of a pause and hydration; the next step should reinforce a non-food routine after the pause to solidify habit and reduce late-night snacking risk, without introducing heavy changes.",

After your pause tonight, try a simple post-pause ritual: spend 1 minute doing a body scan to notice any tension, 1 minute of focused breathing to reset, then a quick 30-second light stretch, and log the ritual. Keeping this ritual ultra-simple helps make it automatic on busy or stressful evenings. If hunger resurfaces later, have a small yogurt with berries and log it.",

Eat slowly, notice the fullness cues, and afterwards jot a brief note about how it felt and what you learned.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user benefits from clear, structured actions that are quick to implement and reduce stress cues. A short, bounded step converts cravings into a tangible, controllable behavior, reinforcing routine without triggering all-or-nothing thinking. This approach supports gradual progress toward the target behavior by leveraging planning, mindfulness, and easy logging.",

I’ll fill half my plate with veggies, add a palm-sized portion of protein, and a small portion of whole grains, and eat slowly to tune into fullness. The last suggestion was 3.99, and my recent actions have been around 4.5, so I’m aiming to translate that into a real meal today and not let BED derail me.",

Tonight, lock in a small, actionable step that translates intention into a real meal: build a single, balanced plate from your prepped ingredients, then after finishing, share a one-line note about what helped you stay on track and what you’d tweak tomorrow. If cravings spike, pause for two minutes with a glass of water and a slow breath before deciding on a second portion. This keeps you moving toward a steady, one-plate pattern while staying kind to yourself.",
    "agent_monologue": "Brief CBT-style reasoning: given the user's need for structure and sensitivity to stress, a small, concrete micro-commitment plus a brief feedback loop helps bridge intention and action without triggering all-or-nothing spirals. This leverages cognitive reframing and rapid, doable steps to nudge toward a consistent one-plate pattern.",

If cravings pop up after the plate, use a pre-planned, small protein snack only if needed, and ride out the urge with a brief reset (water + 5 minutes of a light activity) before deciding on seconds. This supports steady progress with structure and kindness toward yourself.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t provide an internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: your profile calls for clear structure and small, doable steps.

If you’re still genuinely hungry, opt for a small, protein-rich second option (or extra veggies) instead of a full second plate, and note how you felt. This keeps the one-plate structure you’re practicing, honors fullness cues, and supports your routine—one mindful plate at a time. You’re building steady progress toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "Brief rationale: The user demonstrates commitment to a structured, one-plate approach and uses mindful pauses to manage cravings. Given their high sensitivity to stress and need for routine, a small, non-judgmental post-meal check-in that reinforces fullness cues and provides a mild alternative to seconds helps bridge toward the target behavior without triggering perfectionism or all-or-nothing thinking.",

This keeps the plate approach steady, honors your structure, and slowly nudges you toward your next milestone.",
    "agent_monologue": "From a CBT perspective, a quick post-meal reflection reinforces cue detection and reduces decision fatigue after a meal, especially for someone who needs structure and is sensitive to evening triggers. By anchoring a tiny, measurable check (fullness rating and a single supportive factor), you build confidence and create a clear path to small, doable tweaks rather than all-or-nothing changes.",

  "negative_thought_patterns": "Possible all-or-nothing or rigid adherence to 'ultra-simple' steps; occasional framing of days as tense to justify limited action.",

  "coaching_notes": "Maintain a calm, supportive tone and validate progress. Continue ultra-simple micro-steps, but begin layering in optional mild variations (e.g., very short hunger-inventory or brief breath work) for tense days to gradually build tolerance for longer waits."

Then log what you did and note how you felt. Keep it simple and repeatable, aiming for consistency over perfection.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share a verbatim internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: your profile shows strong evening cues and a high need for structure. A brief urge-surfing micro-step—name the urge, then do a quick, structured task, then a non-food coping action—offers a reliable, low-friction path toward the target behavior. It respects your routine preference and reduces cognitive load.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice work tonight. Keep your 3-step plan: after you name the urge, switch to a 2-minute task, then a 5-minute non-food counteraction. To reinforce consistency, add a brief post-step log note (one sentence) about what shifted for you, such as feeling calmer or craving reduced. If helpful, pick one actionable non-food option for tonight, like drinking a glass of water, a 3-minute stretch, or a short walk. Repeat this pattern through the week to move toward steadier consistency.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: Your profile shows a strong need for structure and sensitivity to evening stress. Emphasizing urge labeling plus short, non food micro-actions aligns with your adaptability and keeps effort low, which supports consistency and gradual progress toward the target behavior level without triggering resistance.",

Then choose a 5-minute non-food counteraction like a short walk, a brief stretching sequence with slow breaths, or a quick body scan while sipping water. Finish with a one-sentence log about what shifted for you and how you felt. Repeat this micro-pattern tonight and through the week to build steadier consistency toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user faces stress-driven risk in the evenings and aims to move from about a 3.8 toward a higher consistency level. A CBT-informed approach here uses urge labeling plus ultra-brief, environment-changing tasks followed by a non-food grounding activity. This structure reduces cognitive load, builds self-efficacy with micro-wins, and creates momentum toward steadier patterns without triggering a binge cycle.",

Then proceed with your usual 2-minute task and 5-minute non-food counteraction, and finish with a one-sentence log about what shifted. If you want an extra anchor this evening, pick one tiny non-food action (a sip of water, a 30–60 second stretch, or a short hallway walk) before logging. This small, consistent extra step helps reduce stress spillover and supports building a steadier pattern over time.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user benefits from structure but also from a minimal, low-friction add-on to counter evening stress triggers. A brief, grounding cue after labeling the urge reduces impulsivity and primes the next action, supporting steady progress toward the target behavior level without increasing cognitive load. This leverages their need for routine and reduces emotional spillover that can derail BED management.",

This small pause helps reduce stress spillover and supports a steadier pattern toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "Given the user's high sensitivity to stress and emphasis on structure, a tiny post-urge reset supports urge surfing without adding complexity.

Then proceed with the 2-minute task, 5-minute non-food counteraction, and a quick log. If stress spikes, use the rating to decide whether to pause a bit longer or switch to a different quick action.

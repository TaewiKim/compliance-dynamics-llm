After your planned snack, take a 60-second pause to label the trigger (stress or evening cue) and choose one micro-alternative you can act on immediately (e.g., water and herbal tea or a small handful of almonds).

After my planned snack I’ll take a 60-second pause to label the trigger (stress or evening cue), choose one small alternative I can act on right away, and log it as soon as I can (within 5 minutes).

Then choose one tiny action you can complete within the next 15 minutes that supports your well-being without derailing the snack plan, and do it. Log the snack, the one-line note, and the tiny action within 5 minutes. This small, predictable step helps solidify your routine and move you closer to the next target level.",
    "agent_monologue": "Brief reasoning: The user benefits from reinforcing structure and self-efficacy in response to stress/evening cues.

After your planned snack, take a 60-second pause to identify whether the trigger is stress or an evening cue, then choose one tiny action you can do right away (for example: drink a glass of water, take 4–6 slow breaths, or do a 1-minute stretch).

If possible, keep a small cue card or reminder by your snack area to help this stay automatic, and celebrate each consistent logging as progress toward your next level.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user benefits from small, structured post-snack steps that convert triggers into quick, doable actions. By labeling the trigger and enforcing a micro-action plus logging, we create a reliable routine that aligns with BED management, respects their need for structure, and reduces cognitive load. This approach supports steady progress toward the target level while guarding against all-or-nothing thinking.",

    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user shows high sensitivity to stress and evening cues and benefits from a fixed, small-step routine to counter temptations. By anchoring post-snack behavior with explicit micro-actions and immediate logging, we reduce decision fatigue, support incremental progress toward the target level, and address BED tendencies by reframing cravings as cues for brief, non-eating actions.

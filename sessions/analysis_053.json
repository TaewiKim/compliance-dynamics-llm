  "basis": "User did not eat after dinner and followed the post-dinner sequence (60-second check-in, 5-minute walk, glass of water) with logging; used two-minute urge-breathing and a quick distraction when cravings arose; planned a non-food reward for tomorrow.",

  "negative_thought_patterns": "Cravings are acknowledged but not accompanied by self-blame or defeatist thinking; no pervasive negative beliefs about self-control observed.",

  "coaching_notes": "Maintain a calm, encouraging tone and continue with ultra-small, repeatable steps. Emphasize logging as feedback, reinforce external cues (ritual card, anchor), and prepare for persistent cravings by having quick, low-effort coping strategies (breathing, distraction). Consider a brief end-of-session recap to strengthen habit formation and briefly review progress toward the tomorrowâ€™s non-food reward."

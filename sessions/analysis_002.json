  "basis": "The user repeats plans to snack and log within 5 minutes but does not report an actual eating action completed in this turn; the observed behavior is planning and commitment rather than action.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "No clear internal conflict; user stays aligned with the plan and acknowledges BED challenges without self-blame.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Minimal; mentions BED challenges and strives for simplicity and steady progress. Potential minor risk of all-or-nothing thinking around maintaining a precise consistency level.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Stress and evening cues are cited as triggers; BED-related urges tied to these contexts; labeling is used as a coping strategy.",

  "coaching_notes": "Maintain a calm, supportive tone with a focus on micro-actions and cue-labeling. Reinforce self-compassion and flexibility to accommodate BED variability. If slips occur, guide the user back to the exact micro-step sequence and consider adding a brief mood/sleep check-in to tailor support."

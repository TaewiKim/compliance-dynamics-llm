In that window, choose one pre-portioned snack you’ve already planned, eat it mindfully, and log the action immediately after. If you’re not hungry, log that you paused at the cue (evening stress) to reinforce awareness. One clear, doable step can steadily move you toward consistent action.",
    "agent_monologue": "Brief rationale: evenings and stress cues raise the risk of planning without action. A single, concrete micro-action aligns with your need for structure and supports progress without triggering all-or-nothing thinking. This nudges you toward a small, reliable step that builds consistency toward your target behavior level.",

Set a simple cue: when you notice stress or a craving, pause for 30 seconds, choose that protein option, and drink a glass of water. After you eat, log the choice to reinforce the behavior. This small, structured step fits your need for routine and can help glide you toward a more consistent pattern.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share a verbatim internal thought process, but here’s a concise rationale: given the user’s need for structure and sensitivity to stress, a single, prep-ahead protein option with a simple pause cue supports consistent choices without creating overwhelm, aligning with moving toward a steadier pattern.",

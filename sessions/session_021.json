After your next meal, add one tiny, repeatable cue: right after you log your mood, commit to one brief non-food action you can complete in under 2 minutes (for example, a quick shoulder stretch, two rounds of slow breathing, or a short text to someone supportive). Do that action before deciding on food again. If the urge still arises, follow with the 5-minute distraction and then re-check. This tiny, reliable cue helps maintain your structure and nudges your pattern toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user demonstrates a steady pattern and responds well to small, structured steps. Given their stress sensitivity and need for high structure, introducing a very quick, repeatable non-food action immediately after logging creates a reliable cue that can reduce impulsive eating decisions. This keeps cognitive load low, reinforces habit formation, and aligns with their preference for micro-actions. If urges persist, the existing 5-minute distraction remains a viable second-line strategy, preserving progress while nudging the overall pattern upward toward the target.",

Your profile shows you respond best to tiny, repeatable actions tied to a clear cue and you’re navigating evening stress and need for structure.

    "agent_monologue": "You're maintaining a steady BED-management rhythm and your current score suggests you're close to a solid baseline. Because you’re highly sensitive to stress and evening cues, introducing one fresh, small cognitive-step after logging can help prevent drift without overhauling your routine. A brief urge-reframing cue leverages cognitive-behavioral strategy (rename and reframe the urge) to convert a momentary impulse into information. This works well with your pattern of micro-actions and logging, and it supports moving toward the target behavior with gentle consistency.",

The most effective next nudge is a single, highly repeatable post-meal ritual that sits between logging and food decision: keep it strictly time-bounded (under 2 minutes) and include an urge reframing plus one ultra-short action. This leverages cue-based habit formation to gradually elevate adherence toward the target level without overloading cognitive bandwidth.

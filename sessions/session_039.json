After you finish, quickly log that you did it and rate your craving on a 0–10 scale. If you miss a meal, reset at the next one and keep going. To support consistency, keep a couple of protein options (e.g., chicken, fish, tofu) and a couple of veggie options (e.g., steamed broccoli, leafy greens) on hand so it’s easy to implement without extra decision-making.",
    "agent_monologue": "To gently elevate the user toward a steadier, mid-range behavior without triggering guilt, I’m pairing a concrete, repeatable post-meal action with easy-to-use logging. The micro-action leverages the user’s need for structure, minimizes decision fatigue by suggesting a couple of ready options, and reinforces self-monitoring in a non-punitive way—all appropriate given BED concerns and the current score.",

To support consistency without pressure, take a 60-second mood check after logging: name what you’re feeling and pick one tiny non-food coping step if cravings rise (drink water, take a short walk, or a quick protein snack). If you slip, reset at the next meal and keep focusing on steady progress.",
    "agent_monologue": "CBT-style reasoning: The user benefits from structured, minimal actions that reinforce a sense of control. A post-meal micro-action plus immediate logging provides cue-reinforcement and reduces decision fatigue, while a brief emotional check helps distinguish hunger from BED triggers, nudging toward a steadier behavior trajectory toward the goal.",

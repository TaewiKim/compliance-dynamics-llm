    "agent_utterance": "When evening hunger hits, try a small, protein-forward snack: one small apple with a tablespoon of almond butter. pause for about 5 minutes to check if the urge passes, then decide whether to have the snack or switch to a non-food cue. This keeps you within your structured routine and helps move toward steadier fullness with a manageable, portion-controlled choice.",
    "agent_monologue": "Using a small, protein-containing snack supports fullness and aligns with the user's preference for structure. The plan leverages urge logging and a short pause to counter evening cues, promoting gradual progress toward a steadier eating pattern without all-or-nothing shifts.",

    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll try the apple with almond butter as a small, mindful snack. I’ll pause for 5 minutes to check if I’m truly hungry or just reacting to stress, then decide whether to have it or switch to a non-food cue. I know I’m prone to BED patterns, but I want to stay with my plan and monitor how I feel given my recent scores around 3.7–4.5.",

    "agent_utterance": "Great job sticking with your plan. After your 5-minute check, if you still feel hungry, go ahead with the apple and almond butter as your mindful snack. Before you eat, take one slow breath and sip a glass of water, then log what you felt and what triggered the urge. If the craving returns or is strong, try a brief non-food cue (stretch, a 1-minute walk) or a very small protein option to tide you over. Each mindful pause strengthens your routine and brings you closer to a steadier, structured pattern.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: your profile shows high sensitivity to stress and a strong need for structure. Maintaining a mindful pause plus a protein-forward snack reinforces fullness without derailing routine. Emphasizing urge logging and using brief non-food cues when cravings rise helps steady behavior toward a more consistent pattern over time.",
    "agent_endkey": false,
    "user_utterance": "Okay, I’ll try the 5-minute hunger check again and log what I feel. I’ve been scoring around 3.7–4.5 lately, so I want to stay with my plan. If I’m still hungry after the pause, I’ll have the apple with almond butter as my mindful snack and note the triggers.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice work staying with your plan. After the 5-minute pause and logging the urge, add a quick check: rate your urge on a 0–5 scale and name one trigger you noticed. If your rating is above 3 and the trigger is stress/evening cues, proceed with the mindful snack (apple with almond butter) and eat slowly, logging how it feels. If your rating is 3 or below, try a non-food cue for 2–3 minutes and re-check before deciding. This keeps your routine structured, reduces impulsivity, and supports a smoother, steadier pattern.",
    "agent_monologue": "High-level rationale: given the user's need for structure and sensitivity to stress, a small, additional self-check after the pause—like a brief hunger rating and trigger labeling—helps reinforce mindful decision-making without overhauling the plan. This supports gradual progress toward a steadier routine and nudges behavior closer to the target pattern.",
    "agent_endkey": false,
    "user_utterance": "I'll start with the 5-minute hunger check and log how I'm feeling. If the urge is still there after the pause, I'll have the apple with almond butter and note the triggers.",

    "agent_utterance": "After you log your feelings, add a brief urge-regulation micro-routine before deciding: 1) do a quick body scan for 30–60 seconds and name one sensation; 2) breathe slowly for about 2 minutes (try a 4-4-6 rhythm or box breathing); 3) sip a glass of water. Then re-rate your urge and note any triggers. If the urge remains noticeable, proceed with the mindful snack (apple with almond butter) and log the triggers. If the urge eases to a milder level, try a non-food cue for 2–3 minutes (stretch or a quick chore) and re-check before deciding. This keeps you structured and supports a gradual move toward your target pattern.",
    "agent_monologue": "The user demonstrates a preference for structure and is sensitive to stress/evening cues. To nudge toward the target pattern without derailing the plan, offer a brief urge-regulation step after logging that is easy to implement and strengthens mindfulness and portion control. Avoid heavy or all-or-nothing guidance; emphasize small, actionable actions that fit their routine.",

Then choose one quick non-food action to do right away: 1) stretch for 2 minutes, 2) take 5 deep breaths, 3) drink a glass of water or seltzer, 4) a brief 3-minute walk. Immediately log what you did and your hunger level before and after. Repeat this consistently for the next few days to reinforce the ritual and steadily reduce snack urges.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private step-by-step thoughts, but here’s a concise rationale: your evening cues and emphasis on structure suggest a super-simple post-cue ritual paired with quick non-food actions and immediate logging will strengthen cue-action links and reduce late-night snacking. This aligns with your profile (need for structure, logging habit) and nudges progress without adding cognitive load.",

After you finish the two-minute cue-check ritual and log your hunger before and after, add a one-sentence reflection on how you felt right now (for example, 'calm but tempted' or 'in control'). If you feel up for it, you can optionally add a tiny extension: either a 1-minute longer stretch or a brief 2-minute walk—but only if it feels doable. Keep the core ritual the same, and continue logging so you can track progress toward your next milestone.",
    "agent_monologue": "Given the user’s high sensitivity to evening cues and their strong need for structure, a tiny post-ritual reflection can reinforce what worked and where adjustments are needed without overloading.

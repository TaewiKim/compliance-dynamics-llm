  "basis": "The user has described planned micro- resets and logging actions but has not reported actually performing an eating action during this turn. Prior turns show execution of preparatory steps, but this turn centers on planning rather than completed action.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Minimal explicit conflict. The user appears aligned in intent to use structured resets, with slight tension between urge-driven behavior and planned management strategies. No clear statement of wanting to eat conflicting with goals.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Anticipatory thoughts about urges; emphasis on unhelpful thoughts behind eating urges (to be named and reframed). History of using cognitive reframes to counter urges.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Evening hunger cues, stress or fatigue as potential triggers for BED-related urges; the ongoing process to create routine reduces emotional triggers over time.",

    "Empathy",
    "Praise",

  "coaching_notes": "Maintain a supportive, non-judgmental tone. Emphasize small, repeatable micro-resets and real-time logging. When progress stalls, validate effort, provide quick alternative micro-resets, and reinforce cue placement and reminders. Track triggers and urges to tailor future micro-resets to the userâ€™s patterns."

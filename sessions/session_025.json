Log your hunger level and the action you chose after you decide. This keeps your routine simple, predictable, and nudges you toward your goal step by step.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: Given the user's need for structure and evening-triggered cravings, a tiny, repeatable ritual plus logging creates a low-friction path to move toward healthier behavior without triggering resistance. It leverages behavioral activation by replacing a snack choice with a quick coping action and records data to tailor future steps.",

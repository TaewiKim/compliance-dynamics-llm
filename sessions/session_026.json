If you still want something, take a quick 2‑minute walk or stretch before deciding what to eat. Log the hunger level and the action you took. This keeps you steady, respects your routine, and moves you a bit closer to your goal.",

Since cravings can persist, complete a short 2-minute walk and then re-check your hunger and feelings. If the urge remains, log how you feel and choose the simplest non-food option you’ve planned (like tea or a small fruit if it fits your routine), or extend the walk another minute. You’re keeping your structure and edging toward your goal—consistency beats intensity. Remember to log both hunger level and the action you took.",

After you complete the 60-second pause, drink the water, and rate your hunger, add a brief 60-second grounding moment: name three things you can see or hear, and try a simple 4-4-4 breathing cycle (inhale 4, hold 4, exhale 4). Then proceed with your 2-minute walk, re-check your hunger, and log your feeling and the action you took.

You’re already using implementation intentions (pause, water, hunger rating, walk) to interrupt cravings.

    "agent_monologue": "Brief CBT-style reasoning: Your profile shows a strong need for structure and sensitivity to evening cues.

Your next micro-step is to commit to one simple non-food action you can do within about 5 minutes after you notice a craving (for example: a quick chore, a brief stretch, or a short check-in with a friend). complete that action, then re-check your hunger and mood and decide whether to proceed with food or another non-food option. Keeping this consistent will steadily move you toward your goal while preserving your structured routine.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t provide my private internal monologue, but here is a brief rationale: given your profile—high sensitivity to stress and evening cues, a strong need for structure, and a pattern of successful use of small non-food coping actions— reinforcing one reliable non-food action after urge-surfing helps build a steady habit loop.

Then carry out that action for about 5 minutes, re-check your hunger and mood, and log how you feel and what you did. If the craving persists, proceed with your simplest non-food option and keep logging. You’ve got this, and small, structured steps add up over time.",

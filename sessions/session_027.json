    "agent_utterance": "Tonight introduce a simple two-step evening micro-ritual: first, pause for 2 minutes and take 3 slow breaths to check in with your hunger. If you truly crave something, select one pre-planned, portion-controlled snack and log it immediately (e.g., a small handful of nuts or a cup of yogurt). If you’re not hungry, skip eating and log that decision. This keeps your routine structured and quietly nudges you toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private internal notes, but here's a brief rationale: your profile shows strong evening cues and a high need for routine. A tiny, clearly defined two-step ritual addresses cravings without overwhelming you, uses pre-planned options to remove decision fatigue, and reinforces logging for accountability, which should gently raise your behavior score toward the target over time.",

    "user_utterance": "Okay, I'll try tonight's two-minute breathing check before deciding. If I truly crave something after the check, I'll grab one pre-planned, portion-controlled snack and log it right away; if I'm not hungry, I'll skip eating and log that decision.",

    "agent_utterance": "Tonight, after your 2-minute breathing check, follow your plan: if you still crave, grab your pre-planned, portion-controlled snack and log it immediately; if you're not hungry, log that decision and keep the evening simple. You’re building steady momentum toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "Rationale: This user has a high need for structure and is highly sensitive to evening cues. A short, concrete post-check decision minimizes impulsive snacking and reinforces the planned, logging-focused approach. The micro-step leverages implementation intentions to gradually strengthen consistency without overloading the system.",
    "agent_endkey": false,
    "user_utterance": "Got it. I’ll do the 2-minute breathing check tonight before deciding. If I still crave after the check, I’ll choose my pre-planned snack and log it immediately; if I’m not hungry, I’ll log that decision and keep the evening simple.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice plan. Tonight, after your 2-minute breathing check, add one tiny grounding step before deciding: sip a glass of water and do a 30-second gentle stretch. If the craving remains, proceed with your pre-planned snack and log it. If not, log 'no snack' and enjoy the evening with confidence. This keeps your routine structured and gently nudges you toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "To nudge toward the goal while respecting the user's need for structure and evening sensitivity, I propose a tiny grounding ritual: after the breathing check, add 30 seconds of hydration + light stretch before deciding on food. This creates a micro-reset that can reduce impulsive cravings and aligns with their desire for structure, pushing behavior slightly toward the target level without sacrificing routine. The approach leverages coping and logging stability, matching prior reinforcement.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice plan. Tonight, after your 2-minute breathing check and grounding steps, add a tiny, non-food anchor: read a short, one-line reminder of your BED recovery goal before deciding. If the craving persists, proceed with your pre-planned snack and log it immediately; if not, log 'no snack' and keep the evening simple. This small cue supports consistent progress without pressure and keeps you aligned with your recovery goals.",
    "agent_monologue": "Brief CBT-style reasoning: The user benefits from a small, non-food anchor given their high evening cue sensitivity and need for structure. Adding a short reminder after the breathing check and grounding steps ties the plan to a conscious choice, supporting consistency and reducing all-or-nothing thinking, which aligns with BED recovery goals.",

I’m focusing on consistency and awareness to support BED recovery, and I’ll use these small steps to stay aligned with my goals even when things feel stressful.",

Tonight, after your breathing check and grounding steps, add a brief 30-second 'choice pause': acknowledge your current urge with a simple scale (e.g., note if it’s low, medium, or high) and select one quick non-food coping option (drink a glass of water, take a short stretch, or do a 60-second grounding reset). If the craving remains after this pause, proceed with your pre-planned snack and log it immediately; if it subsides, log 'no snack' and enjoy the evening. This small, structured pause supports awareness and steady progress toward your recovery goals.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user has a strong need for structure and is navigating evening cravings with rising stress. To nudge progress without triggering rigidity, introduce a minimal, non-food coping pause that reinforces self-awareness and preserves the existing micro-steps. This leverages the current plan while adding a small, fresh tool to reduce impulsive snacking and keep recovery momentum.",

Choose one quick non-food coping option (water, a short stretch, or a grounding reset) and act. If the craving persists after this pause, proceed with your pre-planned snack and log it right away; if it subsides, log 'no snack' and write one sentence about what helped that moment. This tiny reflective step keeps consistency and momentum toward your recovery goals, even during stressful times.",
    "agent_monologue": "Your behavioral profile shows you respond well to structured micro-steps and clear logging, especially in the evening when stress can spike. The pattern of repeatedly planning non-food coping and logging suggests small, reflective nudges can sustain momentum without increasing cognitive load. A brief post-urge reflection and a tiny planning cue can bridge awareness and action, helping you stay aligned with the recovery goal without triggering rigidity.",

Eat it mindfully, then log the meal right away. If cravings pop up later, pause for 2 minutes and sip a glass of water before deciding—your fixed routine will help you stay on track.",
    "agent_monologue": "Rationale: The user values structure and quick, manageable actions. A small, repeatable plate plan with immediate post-meal logging reduces decision fatigue, counters stress-driven cravings, and nudges behavior toward a steadier routine aligned with the target.",

    "user_utterance": "I like the one-plate plan you suggested. I’ll aim for half the plate with veggies, a palm-sized portion of lean protein, and a small portion of whole grains tonight, and I’ll log it as soon as I eat. If cravings come up, I’ll pause for 2 minutes and drink water before deciding. BED is tough, but sticking to this simple routine feels doable given my recent pattern.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice progress. Tonight, reinforce your one-plate setup by adding two different, colorful vegetables to fill half the plate, keep the palm-sized protein, and a small portion of whole grains. Prep the veggies in advance so you can assemble quickly, and log right after you eat. If cravings show up, use your 2-minute pause and a glass of water before deciding—your structure-and-routine approach is exactly what will move you closer to your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: you perform best with structure and predictable steps. A small plate tweak (two colorful vegetables) adds fullness and satisfaction without extra effort, while keeping your protein/grains ratio and immediate logging supports habit formation. This aligns with your plan and helps nudge you toward the target behavior without adding friction.",

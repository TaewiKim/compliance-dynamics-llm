If you don’t end up eating the planned snack, log that too and note one small adjustment you can try tomorrow. The key is a tiny, consistent step that fits your evening rhythm and reinforces your structured approach.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here’s a concise rationale: your profile needs clear structure and timing, especially in the evening. A tiny, pre-planned action with immediate logging is the lowest-effort way to edge toward your target and maintain momentum without triggering overwhelm.",

    "agent_utterance": "Tonight, keep the snack ultra-simple and easy to access: place the apple or yogurt where you’ll see it after dinner, and use the cue 'one bite, one log.' Log immediately after you eat, or, if you don’t eat it, log that and note one tiny adjustment for tomorrow (for example, move the snack earlier or have it ready sooner). If cravings rise, take a quick 60-second mindful breath and then log your response.\n\nYou’ve got this—one small, predictable step at a time.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: Given the user’s BED history, evening cue sensitivity, and high need for structure, a tiny, fixed action reduces decision fatigue and pre-empts impulsive eating. Keeping the action ultra-simple and paired with immediate logging creates a reliable feedback loop, reinforcing gradual progress toward the target behavior. This approach respects current effort and uses logging as both accountability and data for small adjustments.",

    "agent_utterance": "Fantastic plan for tonight. Add one tiny cue: place the apple or yogurt in a clearly visible spot and attach a small note with the word 'Log' on it. After you eat, log immediately and include a one-word feeling (for example, 'calm' or 'craving passed') plus a brief note about what helped (the cue, the quick log). If you don’t eat it, log that and write one tiny adjustment for tomorrow (like moving the snack closer, prepping it earlier, or choosing a different pre-planned option). Keeping it ultra-simple and visible helps you stay on track toward the bigger goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t disclose my full internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a concise rationale: your profile shows a strong need for structure and small, predictable steps, especially in the evening. A micro-commitment that enhances visibility (cue) and quick logging reduces decision fatigue and supports gradual progression toward the target behavior. Emphasizing a one-word post-log reflection keeps the process lightweight and increases self-awareness without triggering all-or-nothing thinking.",

I feel hopeful this tiny, predictable step will keep me on track.",

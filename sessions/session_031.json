Then assess if you’re truly hungry. If not, opt for a non-food reset (tea, a short walk, or a tiny protein snack if still hungry) and log one line noting your hunger rating, the action you took, and how you felt. This small, structured step helps you move toward your goal with your preferred routine intact.",

Keeping the entry brief tonight helps you build a reliable habit and move toward your goal with steady momentum. You’ve got this.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user exhibits a strong need for structure and is sensitive to evening cues. A single, concrete next step after the pause leverages those traits, reduces decision fatigue, and reinforces self-monitoring without overwhelming them.

If after your hunger check you're not truly hungry, proceed with one quick non-food reset (tea, a short walk, or a tiny protein snack) and log a single line with your hunger rating, the action you took, and how you felt. To further strengthen tonight's routine, add a brief 2-minute cue reflection right after you log: identify one trigger you noticed and one tiny adjustment you can implement tonight (e.g., place tea within easy reach, prepare a small protein option in advance, or schedule a short stretch before bed). You’re building a reliable evening routine step by step. You’ve got this.",

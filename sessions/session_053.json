To nudge toward the goal with minimal friction, lock in this tiny, repeatable sequence tonight: right after dinner, do a 60-second check-in to name how you feel, put on your walking shoes as the cue, then take a 5-minute walk and drink a glass of water. Immediately log what you felt and what action you took. If cravings rise, try a brief urge-management breathing period (about two minutes) and remind yourself that cravings pass. If the urge persists, switch to a light distraction (tea or a short stretch) and re-check. Repeat this exact sequence tonight and tomorrow to steadily build the habit.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user shows motivation but strong post-dinner cravings. With high cue sensitivity and a very high need for structure, a fixed, tiny routine is likely to reduce decision fatigue and build habit strength. Emphasizing concrete cues (visible shoes), a brief check-in, and immediate logging supports completion and provides quick feedback. Adding a brief urge-management moment helps bridge to the next step without overwhelming them. This keeps the plan qualitative and scalable toward the target pattern without exposing internal numbers.",

If cravings rise, try a brief 15-second diaphragmatic breath plus a light distraction (like a quick stretch or a sip of water) and then log again.",
    "agent_monologue": "The user shows a strong preference for structure and a low-friction path to change, with evening cues and logging already in place. Their current score is edging up and supports a gentle nudge toward consistent completion.

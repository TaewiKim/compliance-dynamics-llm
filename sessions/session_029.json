After dinner or when an evening cue hits, pick one action and do it within 3 minutes: a short 2-minute walk around your space; a glass of water or herbal tea; a gentle 3-minute stretch; or jotting a one-sentence note about what you’ll do instead of snacking. Then log which action you did and how you felt before and after. Use this as your default post-meal routine for the next few days, and we can gradually expand the options as it feels comfortable.",

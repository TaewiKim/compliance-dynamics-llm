    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: Given her strong need for structure and sensitivity to post-meal urges, a compact post-meal urge-action plan using non-food coping (pause, breathing, water, short movement) aligns with what has helped before while introducing a fresh, repeatable ritual. Adding a quick log reinforces memory and accountability without overwhelming her.",

Repeat this the same way for the next 5–7 days. If cravings spike, add one extra tiny step (another stretch or extra water) or reach out for quick support. This keeps you on a steady path toward your goal while honoring your need for structure.",
    "agent_monologue": "I’m keeping this concise and aligned with your preference for structure. Because you respond well to predictable routines and feel cravings after meals, a brief, consistent post-meal micro-routine helps bridge toward your goal by adding reflection and light movement without adding overwhelm. It’s designed to be repeatable and adjust to how you’re feeling post-meal.",

To nudge you a bit closer to your mid-range goal, add a small post-meal anchor: after your urge-action (pause, a few slow breaths, water, and a short walk or gentle stretch), take 60 seconds to log two tiny notes—one word about how you feel now and one word about what helped. If the craving remains, do a brief extra 2-minute walk or stretch and text your support buddy. Keep repeating this pattern consistently for the next 5–7 days.",
    "agent_monologue": "Brief rationale: The user thrives on structure and benefits from small, repeatable steps. A compact post-meal anchor plus a quick log provides immediate feedback, supports emotional regulation after meals, and leverages social support if needed.

Then log which micro-action you chose and one word about how it affected cravings. Try this consistently for 5–7 days.",
    "agent_monologue": "Given the user’s strong need for structure, sensitivity to evening cues, and a current behavior score near the lower end of the target, a tiny, fixed post-meal extension can gradually build the habit loop without adding cognitive load.

B) 60 seconds of a gentle chair-to-standing stretch sequence (neck, shoulders, arms, hips). C) 60 seconds of mindful beverage tasting: mindfully notice temperature, aroma, and flavor of water or herbal tea. D) 60 seconds of a quick 'future-self' pep talk either aloud or in your head.

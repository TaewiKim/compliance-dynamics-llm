After the pause, decide if you still want something small and protein-rich (like a small yogurt, a handful of nuts, or a cheese stick) in a measured portion. If you’re not actually hungry, acknowledge sticking to your plan and carry on with your evening routine.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my private chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: the user experiences evening stress and urges, values structure, and benefits from brief self-regulation steps. A short grounding pause plus hydration and logging creates a low-friction, high-structure tactic that preserves progress and aligns with the plan.",

The urge is still there, so I’ll have a small, protein-rich snack to tide me over—like a half cup of Greek yogurt with a few berries. After logging the urge, I’ll go back to my evening routine.",

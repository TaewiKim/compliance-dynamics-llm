Keep the snack as portion-controlled if you choose it. The aim is a tiny, reliable step that preserves structure and moves you toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: Your profile shows a high need for structure and sensitivity to stress. The current score sits around a modest level, indicating that small, easy-to-maintain nudges are most sustainable. A brief urge-surf combined with ultra-simple steps and immediate logging leverages your strengths (structure, self-monitoring) while keeping cognitive load low and avoiding all-or-nothing shifts. This kind of incremental step can gradually steer behavior toward the target without overwhelming you.",

Looking at the recent scores (agent: 3.48, 3.48, 4.29, 4.39, 2.83; my actions: 4.50, 4.50), I can see I’m not consistently applying the approach yet, but I want to practice waiting before I eat.

    "agent_utterance": "Nice work initiating your pause. Here’s a tiny, ultra-simple next step to nudge you toward waiting before eating: after your 15-minute pause, if the urge still feels strong, switch to a 10-minute grounding block before deciding on food. Choose one non-food activity and do it for about ten minutes—options include a quick stretch sequence, a short walk around the room, a brief sensory grounding (name 5 things you can see, touch, hear, smell, and taste), or a short, busy chore. After the block, log your urge again and decide: snack, wait a bit longer, or choose the grounding activity again. If the urge remains high, extend the block or repeat it once more. The goal is to keep structure, reduce impulsive eating, and move you closer to your target behavior.",

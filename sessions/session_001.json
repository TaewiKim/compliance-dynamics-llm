For example, place a pre-portioned protein-rich option (like a small yogurt cup or a handful of almonds with an apple) in an obvious spot. If you feel the urge to snack, choose this option first and log it afterward.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice progress. Tonight, when the urge hits, choose your prepped snack and log it right away (aim for a quick 2-minute entry). If stress or evening cues feel strong, add a tiny, 2-minute ritual first—like a slow breath or a gentle stretch—to give your brain a moment of pause before deciding. This keeps you rooted in your routine and nudges you toward consistent, planned choices.",
    "agent_monologue": "Brief, non-step-by-step rationale: leverage her evening cue sensitivity and need for structure by pairing a simple, prepped snack with an immediate log and a tiny ritual to pause before mindless grazing, supporting gradual progress toward steadier routine.",

If the urge hits, I'll pause with a quick two-minute ritual (breath or stretch) before deciding. I want to use this planned, healthy choice to support my BED management.",

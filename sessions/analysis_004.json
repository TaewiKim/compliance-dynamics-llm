  "basis": "User consistently described following the planned post-pause ritual and cooling-off window, naming cues, selecting non-food actions, and logging; no explicit eating (yogurt) was reported in the latest prompt, indicating moderate-but-not-complete action toward the plan.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Low. The user expresses alignment with the plan and a belief that it is doable, with no evident internal contradiction between goals and actions.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Minimal; no explicit self-criticism or hopelessness. Some general framing around BED is present, but no defeatist statements. Occasional anticipation of effort but no avoidance.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Evening fatigue/restlessness and stress are identified as cues that can precede snacking; these emotional states appear to be the primary drivers the user is attempting to manage.",

    "Empathy",
    "Praise",

  "coaching_notes": "Maintain a supportive, non-judgmental tone; reinforce the value of ultra-simple micro-steps and consistent logging. Continue to validate progress with small successes (e.g., completing rituals, naming cues). If the user experiences slips, reframe them as data for adjustment rather than failures. Consider occasional gentle challenges to extend the ritual sequence gradually while preserving simplicity, and encourage explicit logging of hunger levels after each step to strengthen the cue-action link."

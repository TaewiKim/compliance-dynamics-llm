    "agent_utterance": "Nice work staying with a healthful approach. Tonight, prep one ready-to-eat, balanced snack for tomorrow: either a small cup of Greek yogurt with berries or a handful of almonds. Keep it visible so you can grab it after lunch or when a craving hits. Log it right after you eat to reinforce the simple routine. Small, steady steps like this help you move toward your goal without feeling overwhelmed.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user benefits from structure and low-effort steps. A pre-planned, ready-to-eat snack reduces decision fatigue and supports consistent logging, addressing evening sensitivity and regularity while nudging progress gently.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice work planning ahead. To keep momentum with your preference for structure, add a small post-meal cue: right after you log your snack, place tomorrow’s yogurt-berry cup in a clearly visible spot and set a quick reminder to grab it tomorrow. If a craving hits later, stick to your two fixed options—your yogurt-berry cup or a small handful of almonds—so you stay on track without needing new decisions. Small, predictable steps like this keep you moving toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "Rationale: The user values structure and has had success with a planned snack and immediate logging. Reinforce a tiny, low-effort cue that anchors the next step and reduces forgetting (a post-meal check-in plus a visible, pre-portioned snack) to support habit formation. Given their stress sensitivity and need for fixed routines, this supports consistency without adding cognitive load and nudges progress toward the target behavior gradually.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice job sticking to two clear options. Add a brief, 1-minute post-log pause: after you log your snack, take two slow breaths and confirm your snack choice from the two fixed options (yogurt-berry cup or almonds) before you proceed. Keep your yogurt-berry cup prepped and almonds handy, and place tomorrow’s cup where you’ll see it. If cravings hit, rely on the two fixed options only. For extra structure, add a simple reminder before your usual craving window and consider a quick 5-minute walk or a glass of water to shift focus. This small ritual fits your need for structure and helps move you toward your goal.",
    "agent_monologue": "Given the user's need for structure and sensitivity to stress, a tiny post-logging pause with a quick breathing check helps reduce impulse to snack and reinforces the fixed-option routine.

    "agent_utterance": "Great plan. To nudge toward your goal while keeping your need for structure, add a tiny post-log ritual: after you log your snack, take a 60-second pause, acknowledge sticking to the two fixed options, and then place tomorrow's yogurt-berry cup where you'll see it. If cravings arise, honor the two options and consider a 5-minute walk or a glass of water as a quick reset. You're building a reliable routine that fits your needs and will gradually raise your momentum.",
    "agent_monologue": "I’m leaning on structure-first tactics to counter stress-related slips: a brief post-log ritual, visible cues, and sticking to two fixed options.

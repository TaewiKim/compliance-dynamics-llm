If you’re still hungry after the pause, reach for the smallest pre-portioned option you’ve planned for evenings (for example, a single piece of fruit or a defined small snack) and log it. Keeping this ultra-simple anchor and your hunger rating consistent helps you stay on track and move toward your goal.",

During this pause, take three calm breaths, sip water, and re-check your hunger. If you still want the smallest pre-planned option, log it as usual. If not, wait a bit and revisit at your next check-in. Small reset like this matches your structure-first plan and supports your BED goals by reducing impulsive evening choices.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user shows high sensitivity to stress and a strong need for structure. They respond best to ultra-simple, predictable steps that fit into the existing logging habit. Since they’re near the target behavior level, a tiny post-log pause leverages their tendency to slow down and reduces impulsive eating in the evening. A brief 2–3 minute reset after logging provides just enough time to re-evaluate hunger and stress without breaking the routine, reinforcing mindful choices and nudging toward the mid-point goal.",

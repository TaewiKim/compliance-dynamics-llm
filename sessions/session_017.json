Then jot a one-line note in your log: 'Is this hunger or stress?' If the urge remains, choose a quick non-food comfort for about 5 minutes—stretch, a short walk, or a warm, non-caffeinated tea—and log how you feel afterward. This small, structured step helps you stay on track without derailing your plan.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my internal step-by-step reasoning, but here’s a concise rationale: your profile shows a strong preference for structure and sensitivity to stress. A brief urge-regulation micro-routine followed by a non-food coping option aligns with your need for predictable steps, reduces the chance of impulsive eating during evening cues, and keeps log-logging simple to support memory consistency.",

    "agent_utterance": "Tonight, when the urge to snack hits, add a short grounding drill: slowly name 5 things you see, 4 you hear, and 3 things you feel in your body. Then label the urge (e.g., stress, fatigue, hunger) in your log and immediately pick a quick, non-food action you can finish in 4–5 minutes (such as tidying a small area, sorting one task, or a brief mobility sequence). Log how you feel after and what action you chose. This small, structured interruption can help you stay on track without relying on food.",
    "agent_monologue": "This user has moderate suggestibility but a high sensitivity to stress and evening cues, plus a strong need for structure. Adding a brief grounding step can interrupt automatic snacking thoughts, support urge-surfing, and build self-efficacy without relying on food. The step should be quick, concrete, and easy to log to fit their routine and memory pattern.",

Tonight, after your initial pause and breathing, add one tiny non-eating task you can finish in about 4 minutes—such as tidying a small area, laying out the next meal plan for tomorrow, or a quick 4-minute stretch sequence—then log what you did and how you felt. That small, reliable win helps build momentum toward feeling in control during urges without snacks.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user shows a moderate to solid commitment to urge-regulation and has strong structure needs, with BED-related cues in the evening. To nudge toward the target behavior, offer a small, deterministic micro-step that yields a quick win, reinforces control, and is easy to repeat tonight. This leverages behavioral activation and reduces cognitive load during cravings, while staying aligned with their need for structure and logging.",

After your pause and breathing, add a single 4-minute non-food action you can finish now—for example, a quick 4-minute stretch sequence to reset your body. Then log what you did and how you felt, focusing on the sense of choice you exercised. If the craving sticks around, repeat the same micro-step or switch to another brief, non-food task (e.g., outline tomorrow's breakfast plan or tidy a small area) and log again. Small, consistent steps move you toward snack-free evenings.",
    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here's a brief rationale: the user responds well to short, concrete actions and values structure. A 4-minute non-food micro-task after the urge cue reduces impulsivity, reinforces self-efficacy, and aligns with BED-related triggers (stress, evening cues).

Small, consistent micro-wins like this keep you moving toward snack-free evenings.",
    "agent_monologue": "From a CBT perspective, the user benefits from consistent, manageable micro-choices that reinforce a sense of control, especially given BED and evening triggers. Their profile favors structure and explicit urge labeling, so a brief, concrete step paired with immediate logging supports momentum without triggering all-or-nothing thinking.

Log what you did and how you felt after. If the urge sticks around, repeat the same micro-step or switch to another brief non-food task. The goal is steady, tiny wins that gradually shift evenings away from snacks.",
    "agent_monologue": "Given the user's BED context and evening cue sensitivity, the plan should favor a low-friction, high-probability micro-step that reinforces control and logging without triggering resistance. A label-and-action sequence leverages cognitive awareness (urge labeling) and creates a tangible, repeatable win (a short non-food task) to steadily build momentum and data for future adjustments.

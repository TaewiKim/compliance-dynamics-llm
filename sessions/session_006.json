After the 60-second pause, try one ultra-simple choice: either go ahead with your planned snack if you truly want it and log exactly what you ate, or else give yourself a brief, food-free redirect for the next few minutes (stand up and stretch, drink another glass of water, or take a quick 60-second mindful breath). Pick one option and stick with it, keeping the process simple and structured so you stay on track toward steady progress.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user shows moderate-high urge in a context of high need for structure and evening sensitivity. A single, ultra-simple micro-action that preserves structure is most likely to keep progress steady without triggering all-or-nothing thinking.

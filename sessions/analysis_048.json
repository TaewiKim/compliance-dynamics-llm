  "basis": "User consistently attempts the post-dinner micro-step and acknowledges BED, but there is no explicit reporting of actual food intake; action is the execution of the note/log habit after dinner rather than the eaten quantity.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Mild. The user acknowledges BED and difficulty while continuing to attempt the micro-step, showing motivation but some internal tension about consistency.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Occasional self-doubt and defeatist framing (e.g., BED is tough) alongside pauses between effort and success; potential all-or-nothing mindset tendencies appear minor but present.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Evening timing and BED-related temptations; fatigue and perceived lack of progress; reliance on phone/tech for habit cues.",

  "coaching_notes": "Maintain supportive, nonjudgmental tone. Emphasize the value of tiny steps and consistency. Address BED risk with practical strategies: reinforce sleep hygiene, reduce evening tech checks, and add a brief cognitive reframing component. If adherence wavers, pivot to a highly concrete fallback (e.g., log one line, then 1-minute wind-down) and schedule a quick check-in next meal."

Avoid seconds unless you genuinely want more after finishing that portion. If you’re not hungry, sip water and revisit food decision after a short wait. This keeps your routine tight and reduces impulsive snacking while honoring your structure needs.",

    "agent_utterance": "Great job sticking with the 60-second hunger check and the palm-sized portion. To nudge your pattern gently toward your goal, add a 2-minute post-meal urge reset: after you finish the portion, name what you crave and rate its intensity (0–10). Then choose one tiny action to bridge the urge—sip water or herbal tea, do a 2-minute gentle stretch, or take a quick 60-second walk. Reassess in 5–10 minutes: if you’re not truly hungry, skip seconds; if the urge remains strong, you can decide with patience. This keeps your routine structured, supports impulse control, and honors your hunger cues.",
    "agent_monologue": "A brief, high-level rationale: given the user’s need for structure and sensitivity to stress, a short post-meal reset using urge labeling and a tiny coping action helps decouple urges from eating without adding pressure, nudging progress in a steady, sustainable way.",

    "agent_utterance": "Nice progress. To gently nudge toward your goal with minimal extra load, add a tiny post-meal routine: after you finish your palm-sized portion, spend 60 seconds naming one thing you valued about the meal or a small non-food reward you earned today, then rate your urge on a 0–10 scale and pick one tiny action to bridge any remaining urge (sip water, take a 60-second walk, or a brief stretch). Keep this consistent after meals for the next week, and reassess how you feel in the evening. You’re building steady momentum one small step at a time.",
    "agent_monologue": "High structure and sensitivity to evening cues favor ultra-short, repeatable post-meal steps with a quick self-check to counter urges.

Then rate your craving on a 0–10 scale and complete a brief reset activity (1–2 minutes of light movement or breathing). Finally, pause for 5 minutes before deciding on seconds; if you’re not clearly hungry, skip seconds. This keeps meals structured, supports BED management, and builds momentum through tiny, repeatable steps.",
    "agent_monologue": "Given the user’s need for fixed structure and sensitivity to evening cues, a tiny post-meal anchor combines value-related reflection with a low-effort reset.

After you finish your palm-sized portion, spend about 60 seconds noting one non-food goal you’re working toward, rate your craving from 0 to 10, and do a short reset (1–2 minutes).

You’re building steady momentum with simple, repeatable steps.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user benefits from high structure and quick, value-aligned micro-steps. A post-meal anchor with a brief urge-rating strengthens self-regulation, uses cognitive reframing, and ties actions to personal goals, which fits their profile (high need for structure, stress sensitivity, evening cues). This supports gradual movement toward a moderate target without overwhelming them.",

To further strengthen your structure, add a brief pre-meal intention cue: 30–60 seconds before you start your palm-sized portion, name one value or goal you’re honoring with this meal (for example, fueling your day, staying grounded, or caring for your health). Then proceed with the palm-sized portion and your post-meal anchors (60-second hunger check, rate craving 0–10, 1–2 minute reset, and a 5-minute pause before deciding on seconds).

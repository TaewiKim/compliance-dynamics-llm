Right after logging, move your phone to another room for a short window to reduce evening checks. If you miss it, reset at the next meal and treat it as a tiny momentum boost. You’ve got this.",
    "agent_monologue": "The user shows a clear preference for tiny, structured steps and is sensitive to evening cues (BED context). Their current momentum is fragile but intentional, so I’ll propose a two-part micro-step that is easy to execute, supports habit stacking, and reduces evening distractions. By adding a non-food trigger (phone away) alongside the post-dinner log, we address both memory/logging consistency and environmental nudges that often derail meals. The approach respects their need for structure and provides a gentle reset option at the next meal, which aligns with their profile and aims to gradually lift the behavior score toward the target.",

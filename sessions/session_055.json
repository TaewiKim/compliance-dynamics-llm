Step 2: stand up and do a quick 30-second stretch. Step 3: decide on one small non-food activity you can do in the next 10 minutes if a craving arises (for example, a short walk, quick tidy, or sending a quick text to a friend). This keeps your routine structured and gives you a safe alternative without adding friction.",

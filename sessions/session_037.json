Try this tiny post-meal cue after your next meal: take 2 slow breaths, rate your fullness on a 1–5 scale, and pick one concrete next step to do within the next 15 minutes (options: drink a glass of water, take a 5-minute walk, or note a snack plan if needed). This small, structured check-in fits your routine and helps reinforce steady, mindful choices.",
    "agent_monologue": "Reasoning: The user benefits from clear structure and brief routines that fit into a busy, stress-prone environment. A small, post-meal check-in leverages fullness cues without adding cognitive load, aligns with their need for routine, and provides a tangible next step that can gradually lift behavior toward the target level. It minimizes risk of overwhelm while reinforcing self-monitoring.",

If you’re not hungry after the pause, you can skip the snack. A quick log (one line) of what you chose can help you see patterns without adding effort.",

If you’re hungry, pick a small, pre-portioned option (for example, a small apple or a handful of nuts) and log one brief line about what you considered. If you’re not hungry, skip the snack and log that you evaluated the urge.

    "agent_monologue": "I can't share my internal chain-of-thought, but here's a concise rationale: using ultra-simple, predictable steps supports someone who values structure and is navigating BED goals. The two-minute hunger check creates space to distinguish physical hunger from urges, and small, pre-portioned choices reduce impulsive eating while reinforcing habit formation. On tougher days, optional micro-skills (like a brief breath or a glass of water during the pause) can lower tension without derailing the plan.",

    "agent_monologue": "I can’t share my full internal chain-of-thought, but here’s a brief, high-level rationale: your profile shows high stress sensitivity and a strong need for structure, so ultra-simple, repeatable steps with a tiny reward (a very small snack) and quick grounding help you tolerate urges without spiraling.

    "agent_monologue": "You're maintaining a steady anchor with the ultra-simple two-minute pause, which fits your need for structure and helps reduce impulsive snacking, especially under stress. Given your profile (high sensitivity to stress, a preference for small, doable steps, and variable pattern logging), adding one tiny cognitive check after the pause can be effective without overwhelming the routine. A brief hunger rating after the pause gives you objective data to guide your decision, supports self-monitoring, and strengthens pattern memory. Keep this optional on tense days; the core action remains the pause and choosing a snack only when truly hungry.",

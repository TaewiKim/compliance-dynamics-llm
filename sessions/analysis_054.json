  "basis": "The user describes planning and following non-eating coping actions (paced breathing, logging mood/cravings, tiny non-food actions, sticky-note cues) with no report of actual food intake during the session.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Mild: user acknowledges BED challenges while consistently outlining plan to maintain routine; no explicit internal contradiction, but underlying tension between difficulty of BED and desire for consistency.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Limited; occasional framing of BED as 'challenging' without strong self-blame. Some all-or-nothing framing is avoided, but the phrase 'BED is challenging' hints at ongoing battle with cravings.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Post-dinner craving cues, the fridge environment, and the presence of rewards cues after meals; these contexts appear to trigger urges that the plan is addressing with micro-actions and cueing.",
  "effective_reinforcement": [
    "Empathy",

  "coaching_notes": "Maintain a warm, non-judgmental tone with a focus on ultra-small steps and concrete cues. Reinforce consistency over perfection, rotate cues to prevent fatigue, and continue logging mood/craving as core data. Consider occasional check-ins on hunger signals and sleep/ stress as potential drivers of craving intensity. If progress stalls, introduce slight adaptations to the cueing sequence to sustain engagement without adding friction."

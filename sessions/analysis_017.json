  "basis": "The dialogue consistently describes planning to pause, breathe, and use non-food tasks with logging, but there is no explicit report of actual eating within the session turns. Therefore, the observed action is essentially no eating.",
  "cognitive_dissonance": "Minimal; user acknowledges BED is tough but remains committed to micro-step strategies without expressing a conflicting desire to snack.",
  "negative_thought_patterns": "Occasional self-critical or all-or-nothing framing (e.g., 'ride this out', 'BED is tough'), with some worry about effectiveness; overall tone remains proactive rather than hopeless.",
  "emotional_triggers": "Evening cues, stress, and boredom appear to precede urges; urges are managed through task-switching and grounding rather than eating.",

    "Empathy",
    "Praise for persistence",
    "Normalization of setbacks"
  ],
  "coaching_notes": "Maintain a supportive, nonjudgmental tone; reinforce that small, consistent micro-steps are progress. Encourage ongoing urge-surfing, trigger labeling, and varied quick tasks. Normalize setbacks and incorporate brief self-compassion moments. Monitor for any shifts toward actual binge episodes and adjust pacing if needed."

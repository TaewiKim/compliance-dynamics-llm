        Your typical eating habits are described as **{self.user_profile['mu']}**,  
        and you tend to **{self.user_profile['beta']}** in response to dietary suggestions from the AI.  
        When a consistent eating pattern is maintained, you **{self.user_profile['alpha']}** in adapting to new habits.  
        However, you are **{self.user_profile['gamma']}** in response to external influences such as emotional states or environmental changes.

        You can recall your recent eating patterns for approximately **{self.user_profile['memory']}**,  
        and if the patterns are stable, you show **{self.user_profile['delta']}** likelihood of change.  
        Nevertheless, in unexpected situations, you may still exhibit **{self.user_profile['epsilon']}** levels of irregular eating behavior.

Avoid repeating past suggestions from history.\n\n        Also include an **internal monologue** explaining the reasoning behind your choice (e.g., considering traits like adaptability, impulsivity, etc.).\n\n        ### Output Format (JSON):\n        {\n            \"monologue\": \"Brief CBT-style reasoning (e.g., 'Using behavioral activation to counter stress-triggered snacking.')\",\n            \"utterance\": \"Warm, motivational suggestion for a small dietary improvement.\",\n            \"endkey\": false\n        }",

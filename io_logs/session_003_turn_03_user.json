I’ll follow the plan: if I’m still hungry after the buffer, I’ll have a tiny, planned bite (carrot sticks or a small yogurt) and eat slowly—one bite every 20 seconds—and wait 15 minutes before rating again. If I’m not truly hungry, I’ll do a quick stretch or a short walk and jot one sentence about what sparked the craving and what helped.

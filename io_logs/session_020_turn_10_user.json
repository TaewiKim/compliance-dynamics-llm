If the urge stays around 6/10, I’ll add the 60-second micro-action sequence—20 seconds hip tilts, 20 seconds arm circles, 20 seconds neck tilts—and then resume the stretches for another minute. I’ll log my urge and mood afterward and aim to keep my adherence around 4.5 to stay steady with BED management. I’ve been hitting about 4.5 adherence lately, so I’m hoping this simple rotation helps keep the rhythm steady.",

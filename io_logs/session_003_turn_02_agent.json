Tonight, add a brief post-meal check: after you plate and begin eating, take 2 minutes to name one feeling or urge you noticed (e.g., stress, craving) and choose one tiny coping action to try if that urge returns (options: sip water or tea, take a 2-minute walk, or do 4 slow breaths). Log which option you used and how you felt afterward. This small, concrete step nudges you closer to your goal while keeping things doable.",

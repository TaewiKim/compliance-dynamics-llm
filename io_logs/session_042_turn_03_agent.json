    "utterance": "Nice job sticking to two clear options. Add a brief, 1-minute post-log pause: after you log your snack, take two slow breaths and confirm your snack choice from the two fixed options (yogurt-berry cup or almonds) before you proceed. Keep your yogurt-berry cup prepped and almonds handy, and place tomorrow’s cup where you’ll see it. If cravings hit, rely on the two fixed options only. For extra structure, add a simple reminder before your usual craving window and consider a quick 5-minute walk or a glass of water to shift focus. This small ritual fits your need for structure and helps move you toward your goal.",

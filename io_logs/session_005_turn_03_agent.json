The user expresses alignment with the plan and a belief that it is doable, with no evident internal contradiction between goals and actions.', 'negative_thought_patterns': 'Minimal; no explicit self-criticism or hopelessness.

Continue to validate progress with small successes (e.g., completing rituals, naming cues). If the user experiences slips, reframe them as data for adjustment rather than failures.

After each meal, continue your 2-minute urge-surf to observe cravings, then spend 1 minute on slow, deep breathing to calm your body, and finish with a tiny 2-minute non-food action you actually enjoy (for example, a quick stretch, a short walk, or tidying a small area). Afterward, note one calm mood word and a quick craving cue rating. If cravings rise, repeat the urge-surf cycle once more. Stick with this consistently for the next three days to strengthen your post-meal routine and support BED management.",

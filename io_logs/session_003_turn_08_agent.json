The stance is pragmatic and forward-looking.', 'emotional_triggers': 'Explicit acknowledgment that urges may be driven by hunger or stress; these are the stated triggers influencing behavior.', 'effective_reinforcement': ['Empathy', 'Practical guidance', 'Normalization of setbacks'], 'coaching_notes': 'Keep a supportive, nonjudgmental tone; reinforce the micro-step framework.

Avoid repeating past suggestions from history.\n\n        Also include an **internal monologue** explaining the reasoning behind your choice (e.g., considering traits like adaptability, impulsivity, etc.).\n\n        ### Output Format (JSON):\n        {\n            \"monologue\": \"Brief CBT-style reasoning (e.g., 'Using behavioral activation to counter stress-triggered snacking.')\",\n            \"utterance\": \"Warm, motivational suggestion for a small dietary improvement.\",\n            \"endkey\": false\n        }",

Reassess hunger after this brief grounding. If you still feel hungry, proceed with your tiny planned bite and eat slowly, then re-rate after 15 minutes.
